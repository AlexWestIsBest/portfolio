        <p style="font-style:italic;">Welcome to the West News Support page! We're here to help ensure your experience with our app is as smooth as possible. Below you'll find some common questions and their solutions. If your issue is not addressed here, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us in the app.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">1. How to Set an Alarm</h2>

        <p>To set an alarm in the West News app, simply select a time using the dial on the home page, then press “Set alarm”. You'll also find options for Autoplay or Notify Me by pressing the “Alarm settings” button, which allows you to customize how your news briefing begins in the morning. AutoPlay will play the full broadcast from the beginning at your set alarm time, while Notify Me will play a pre-recorded 30-second intro to the show.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">2. Coverage Options</h2>

        <p>Our news coverage spans five main areas: Sports & Competition, Entertainment & Culture, Science & Technology, Business & Markets, and Politics & World Affairs. Every broadcast includes a brief headline covering news events in each of these categories. Everyone gets the same broadcast- we do not change what news content is included or how news content is discussed in our show for different people.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">3. App Availability</h2>

        <p>Currently, our service is only available to users in the United States and can be downloaded via the US App Store. The broadcasts we produce for our app are exclusive to our app and not available on other platforms. Our broadcasts are typically available by 6:55am US ET Monday through Friday each week.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">4. Subscription and Costs</h2>

        <p>At present, West News is free to use. We do plan to introduce a subscription model in the future. Rest assured, we'll never run ads.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">5. Privacy Concerns</h2>

        <p>We respect your privacy. West News does not collect personally identifiable information. For more details, please refer to our <a href="privacypolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold;">6. Future Updates and Feedback</h2>

        <p>We're constantly working to improve the West News experience. While we don't currently have a built-in feedback system, we'd love to hear your suggestions and comments. Please contact us through other means or write it on a sticky note on your fridge until we get feedback functionality working in our app.</p>
